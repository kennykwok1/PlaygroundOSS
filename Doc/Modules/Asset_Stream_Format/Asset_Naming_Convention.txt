Asset Loading specification & Format
---------------------------------------

1/ Asset Seen from File URL :File URL : "asset:://com/klab/www/asset1.texb"

	'asset::' allow to access to the asset folder.
	
	Asset name is : 'com/klab/www/asset1'
	Plugin ID is  : 'T' (Texture) --> Extension is  : '.texb'

2/ Asset Seen from internal views :	- Own Name stored in Asset stream 		: Char[0]   : PluginId
											  Char[1..n]: Asset Name (non-mangled name)
	Ex. 'Iimage_207'
		I			: Plugin ID (char)
		image_207	: Name

	- Inside a .link file asset				: Use AssetName + Extension in one string : "com/klab/www/asset1.texb"
		
	- In a constant pool for reference		: Same as own name storage.
		Char[0]		: PluginId
		Char[1..n]	: Asset Name
		3/ Assets : Plugin ID, file extension, chunk type, description.

	'I'		.imag		[TIMG]		Define one sprite entity
	'T'		.texb		[TEXB]		Define one texture, grouping multiple sprite definition [TIMG]
	'F'		.flsh		[FLSH]		Define a flash movie, use references on [TIMG]						Special chunk type:
						[LINK]		Special chunk that can be in ANY file but 'route' to another file for loading.

	For now, [LINK] is used inside .imag to force loading of .texb embedding the ressource instead.
	.imag has no data, .texb has all the data.
